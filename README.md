# MPU6050_with_Servo

Designed and implemented a motion-responsive servo control system using the MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope module with an Arduino Uno. The setup detects tilt and movement of the MPU6050, processes the sensor data in real time, and adjusts a Tower Pro MG90S micro servo to follow the movement direction. 

This project demonstrates practical integration of motion sensors with actuators, opening possibilities for robotics, gesture-based control, and stabilizing mechanisms.
